The problem is: HMRC VAT appears to have asked for VAT to be submitted using a tracable system,
without copy paste or manual entry of the submitted figures.

Idea is to meet MTD rules by having a tracable route from
the non-cloud based Solar Accounts to 100PercentVATFreeBridge.



Process -

In Solar - File Export to CSV (export everything)
Run Solar100PcVatFreeBridge on the CSV - producing a summary CSV
which can be sucked into 100percent VAT Free Bridge

Validation -
Run VAT in Solar and eye ball figures.
Visually confirm the figures imported into 100PcVatFreeBridge are the same.

Tip
Run the VAT in Solar AFTER the export.  Saving the VAT Payment can distort if it is in the date range.  The author normally dates the VAT payment on the last day of the VAT period, to avoid it being picked up in the next.

Gotcha
C++11 ie C++ V11
cmake




Usage:
Solar100PcVatFreeBridge -i 'Exported Data - My Company Ltd.csv' -o mtd100PcVatFreeInput.csv -e 6

-e Where one of your vat periods ends in June (-e 6).
-i is the export from Solar Accounts
-o is the csv to be read by MTD PC Free Vat Input tool.


Building:
Need directories that look like
project
    src <this repo>
    build <cmake is run in here>


Building (cross compiling for windows):
Read TC-mingw.cmake
