idea is to meet MTD rules by having a tracable route from Solar to mtd100Percent VAT Free excel sheet.

Process - In Solar - File Export to CSV

Run this on the CSV - producing a summary CSV which can be sucked into 100percent VAT Free Bridge

The following does not like that a column is declared in title, but then does not appear later.

boost installed to /usr/include/boost



Usage:
Solar100PcVatFreeBridge -i 'Exported Data - My Company Ltd.csv' -o mtd100PcVatFreeInput.csv -e 6

Where one of your vat periods ends in June (-e 6).
-i is the export from Solar Accounts
-o is the csv to be read by MTD PC Free Vat Input tool.
