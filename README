The problem is: HMRC VAT appears to have asked for VAT to be submitted using a tracable system,
without copy paste or manual entry of the submitted figures.

Idea is to meet MTD rules by having a tracable route from
the non-cloud based Solar Accounts to 100PercentVATFreeBridge.




Process -

In Solar - File Export to CSV (export everything)
Run Solar100PcVatFreeBridge on the CSV - producing a summary CSV
which can be sucked into 100percent VAT Free Bridge




Gotcha
C++11 ie C++ V11
boost installed to /usr/include/boost
cmake


Usage:
Solar100PcVatFreeBridge -i 'Exported Data - My Company Ltd.csv' -o mtd100PcVatFreeInput.csv -e 6

Where one of your vat periods ends in June (-e 6).
-i is the export from Solar Accounts
-o is the csv to be read by MTD PC Free Vat Input tool.


Building:
Need directories that look like
project
    src <this repo>
    build <cmake is run in here>
